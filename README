Career Crawler

Coded by: --NAME CENSORED--

This software searches and indexes job postings across LinkedIn, Workopolous, and Monster; You can review the postings by double clicking them, right click to assign a "Cover Letter Style" from a previous application, or click "New Style" at the bottom of the window to create a new custom Cover Letter Style (style refers to the main body paragraph of the Cover Letter... the rest is filled in with data scraped from the postings webpage. 

More info will be updated here as time progresses; this is by no means a legitimate README, and this software has not been finished yet!

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:

	- Fully functional for Monster.ca job postings
	
TO DO:

	- Still need to implement Adaptor classes for Workopolous and LinkedIn... coming very soon.
