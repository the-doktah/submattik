I have extensive experience developing with Python (as well as Java and C) from my years at school, business projects during my summer internships, and personal projects. For example, this very application was generated with the aid of custom software that I developed to assist me in my job search (which you can find here: https://github.com/araisbec/career_crawler - written entirely in Python). I have also worked extensively with MySQL and Oracle; I have used Python (and Java) to develop desktop database applications, and also to utilize MySQL in web applications (using the Django framework specifically). In short, I am extremely comfortable planning, developing, and debugging both client and server-side code in Python or Java (in both Windows and Unix), and if I am hired, I am more than confident that I will exceed your expectations by delivering code with excellent readability, usability, and work under whatever time and financial constraints are necessary.
