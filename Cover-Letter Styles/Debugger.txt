My degree in Computer Science - combined with work and personal projects - has given me significant experience with debugging both my own code and others'; I have written many test cases, used scaffolding to strategically isolate parts of complex algorithms more then once, and also have experience stepping through code in debugging utilities (for example, GDB). I have spent hours upon hours debugging code, and as a result, I have become quite effecient at finding and fixing both syntax and logic errors in a minimal amount of time. If I am hired, I am confident that I can deliver highly readable and error-free code on within whatever time contraints necessary.
