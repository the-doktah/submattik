My previous schooling combined with both work and personal projects have given me a significant amount of experience with programming in Java; I have written online applets, server-client systems, desktop applications, and even database applications (using PostGre, Oracle, and MySQL) - all using exclusively java. As a result, I also have a lot of experience debugging java code (in both Eclipse and Netbeans), and using additional java development tools, such as Apache Ant. If I am hired, I am comfident that I will deliver intuitive code with excellent readability, usability, and be able to work within whatever time and financial contraints that are required.
